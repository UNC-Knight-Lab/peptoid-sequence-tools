# peptoid-sequence-tools

## Description
This Python package was developed by the Knight Lab at UNC Chapel Hill to analyze the sequence of a peptoid composed of glycine or N-butylglycine monomers from mass peaks in a MALDI TOF-TOF spectrum. 

## Installation Instructions
A version of Python >= 3.7 is required to use this package. We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) to install Python for those new to Python.
1. Open the terminal (MacOS) or Command Prompt (Windows).
2. Download the package by either:
   1. Download the zip from GitHub (Code -> Download ZIP). Unzip the package somewhere (note the extraction path). The extracted package can be deleted after installation.
   2. Clone this repository (requires git to be installed) with:
      
   `git clone https://github.com/UNC-Knight-Lab/peptoid-sequence-tools.git`

3. Install the package using pip. This command will install this package to your Python environment.
    The package path should be the current working directory `.` if cloned using git. Otherwise, replace it with the path to the `peptoid-sequence-tools` folder.
      
   `pip install .`
   or `pip install /path/to/package/peptoid-sequence-tools`

That's it!

## How to use
The peptoid sequence matching tool can be run as a Python function or from the command line terminal.
The script may prompt the user to make decisions in a tie-breaker scenario.

The input folder is the folder where your peak data is stored as `.txt` files. All `.txt` files in the folder will be combined and used as input.
This allows for multiple spectra of the same sample to be combined for better signal to noise.
Example peak data is included in this repository.

Data will be output as a single Excel workbook in the output folder. In the case that user input was required, multiple candidate sequences are exported to different worksheets in the same Excel workbook.

### To run from terminal:
    
    seq_match -i "/path/to/input_folder" -o "/path/to/output_folder"

Instead of specifying an input or output folder, you can also navigate to your data input folder in the terminal and run the script.
The current working directory will be used as default.
Use the help `-h` tag to see more options.

### To run in Python:
In a Python environment, import the Python function:

    from seq_match import seq_match
    seq_match(input_folder, output_folder)
